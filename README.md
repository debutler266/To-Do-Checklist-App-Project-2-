# README

This is a to-do checklist/grocery checklist application that I created for my Project 2 at GA with a one-to-many relationship.

In this application, I used ruby on rails and the devise gem specfically for user authentication/sign-in/sign-up/etc/.

This is a Ruby On Rails application that allows users to create items for their personal checklist. Users are only able to view the items that they have created upon signing into the app.

Items associated with each user's individual checklist can be marked as complete, edited, and deleted.

***Decided to not give the mark as complete button any current fuctionality because it essentially does the same thing was delete. I will add a different fuctionality for it in the near-future.

# README

This is a to-do checklist/grocery checklist application that I created for my Project 2 at GA with a one-to-many relationship.

In this application, I used ruby on rails and the devise gem specfically for user authentication/sign-in/sign-up/etc/.

This is a Ruby On Rails application that allows users to create items for their personal checklist. Users are only able to view the items that they have created upon signing into the app.

Items associated with each user's individual checklist can be marked as complete, edited, and deleted.

# Purpose

This app was created with the elderly user in mind. I created this app for all to ultilize but specifically, I wanted to give older user an app where they simply could recite their daily/weekly/etc To-do tasks as well as keep track of them in an organized fashion.


# Gems Used
I used the devise gem to institante all the necessary fields and give fuctionality in my app for user authtication (ie. sign in/sign up/log out/).
Minimal Bootstrap gem was used to render Navbar css buttons (Sign In/Out/Log out), and to render the welcoming sign "jumbotron" on the static landing page.

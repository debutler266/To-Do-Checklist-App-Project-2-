# README

This is a to-do checklist/grocery checklist application that I created for my Project 2 at GA with a one-to-many relationship.

In this application, I used ruby on rails and the devise gem specfically for user authentication/sign-in/sign-up/etc/.

This is a Ruby On Rails application that allows users to create items for their personal checklist. Users are only able to view the items that they have created upon signing into the app.

Items in each users individual checklist can be marked as complete, edited, and deleted.
